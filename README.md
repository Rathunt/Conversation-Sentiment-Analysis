# Conversation-Sentiment-Analysis
Analysis on the sentiment in different conversations with my friends.
I have included an example .json file if you wish to do your own analysis.
# Getting Started 
To get your file from all your facebook messages you can go to https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=your_facebook_information and select download your information.

Facebook will then create a file for you (I suggest choosing .json as it is cleaner) to download. This may take a few hours.
